**Quantifying Central Bank Policy Uncertainty in Cambodia: A Topic Modeling Approach**

Understanding and measuring central bank policy uncertainty is vital for predicting economic outcomes, especially in economies like Cambodia, where monetary policy tools are underdeveloped and the economy is heavily dollarized. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of central bank policy uncertainty in Cambodia, employing a dual-model approach using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to classify and measure the intensity of policy uncertainty across key areas such as exchange rate policy, currency stabilization, and de-dollarization. By leveraging articles from major Cambodian news outlets, collected and filtered through automated methods, the research creates a rich dataset spanning from 2014 to 2023. The study estimates the document-topic and topic-word distributions from this corpus of news articles, thereby deriving measures of policy uncertainty. Through a combination of narrative evaluation and comparison with established uncertainty measures, the research offers a robust evaluation of the topic-based uncertainty measures, providing valuable insights into the specific sources of policy uncertainty and their evolution over time. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of economic policy uncertainty in emerging economies and have potential applications in risk assessment, decision-making, policy formulation, and strategic planning. Future directions include integrating additional analytical layers such as sentiment analysis and machine learning predictions to achieve a more nuanced understanding of economic uncertainty. The insights derived from this study hold significant implications for economists, policymakers, investors, and business leaders, emphasizing the importance of this research in the context of Cambodia's unique monetary policy challenges.
