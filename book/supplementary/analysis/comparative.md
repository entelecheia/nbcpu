# Comparative Analysis

**Comparative Analysis of Topic-Based Uncertainty and World Uncertainty Index (WUIKHM)**

In further dissecting the results, a comparative analysis of the topic-based measure and the World Uncertainty Index (WUIKHM) offers additional insights. This comparison elucidates the distinct methodologies and highlights the strengths of the topic-based approach utilized in this research.

1. **Methodological Divergence**:

   - The topic-based measure leverages advanced text analysis, going beyond predefined keywords to capture a broad range of uncertainties in the text, offering a nuanced understanding.
   - In contrast, WUIKHM follows the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (EPU) methodology, relying on the frequency of specific keywords related to economic and policy uncertainty in news articles.

2. **Scope and Adaptability**:

   - The topic-based measure demonstrates superior flexibility and context sensitivity, adept at adapting to new themes and issues, thereby capturing a more comprehensive picture of uncertainty.
   - WUIKHM, while straightforward and replicable, primarily focuses on economic policy aspects, potentially overlooking non-policy-related uncertainties.

3. **Contextual Understanding**:

   - Unlike WUIKHM, the topic-based approach is more adept at understanding the context in which words are used, thus reducing the likelihood of data misinterpretation due to unrelated keyword occurrences.

4. **Dynamic Nature of Uncertainty**:

   - The topic-based measure's adaptability to evolving narratives makes it particularly powerful in capturing diverse uncertainties, especially in rapidly changing scenarios like the COVID-19 pandemic.
   - While WUIKHM provides valuable insights into policy-related uncertainties, its fixed keyword approach may not capture the evolving nature of uncertainties effectively.

5. **Broader Implications**:
   - This researchâ€™s findings, leveraging the topic-based approach, reveal a multifaceted view of uncertainty, encompassing not only policy-related aspects but also societal, technological, and environmental uncertainties.
   - The comparison underscores the topic-based measure's robustness in analyzing uncertainty in various contexts, especially in situations where new sources of uncertainty emerge unexpectedly.

In conclusion, the comparative analysis underlines the topic-based measure's strength in capturing a diverse array of uncertainties, proving its efficacy in the context of Cambodia's monetary policy landscape. This approach's flexibility and adaptability make it a valuable tool in uncertainty analysis, especially in the face of new and unforeseen challenges.

**Anecdotal Evidence of High Uncertainty Scores**

Anecdotal evidence from news articles between October 1 and December 31, 2020, is examined to contextualize the high uncertainty scores observed in the figure. This evidence aligns with the broader themes identified in the comparative analysis:

1. **COVID-19 Pandemic**:

   - Articles frequently mention the uncertainty surrounding vaccine availability and distribution in Cambodia.
   - The impact of the pandemic on key sectors like the automotive industry, tourism, and garment manufacturing is a recurring theme, with several stories detailing disruptions and challenges faced by these industries.

2. **Economic Impacts and Recovery**:

   - Divergent projections and forecasts about GDP contraction and recovery timelines are discussed, reflecting the uncertainty in economic outlook.
   - Varying views from government bodies and international financial institutions about the pace and nature of economic recovery contribute to this uncertainty.

3. **Political Developments**:

   - Political events in Malaysia, including leadership changes and political intrigue, are mentioned as sources of instability, affecting economic stability and investor confidence.

4. **Financial Markets and Investment**:

   - Fluctuations in the stock market, particularly in relation to companies listed on the Cambodia Securities Exchange, highlight the uncertainty in financial markets.

5. **Specific Industry Challenges**:

   - The challenges faced by industries such as garment manufacturing, automotive, and port authorities due to the pandemic are detailed in the articles.

6. **Government Policies and Measures**:

   - Discussions about the Cambodian government's response to the pandemic, including vaccine procurement and distribution plans, reflect the evolving nature of government policies and the associated uncertainties.

7. **Global Economic Context**:

   - References to global economic conditions, international trade dynamics, and the global response to the pandemic indicate the broader economic uncertainties affecting Cambodia.

8. **Socio-economic Conditions**:
   - The impact of the pandemic on employment, labor markets, and societal conditions, including the exacerbation of inequality due to central bank policies in Europe, is also a contributing factor.

**Comparative Analysis of Uncertainty Measures**

- The broader scope and adaptability of the topic-based measure offer a comprehensive understanding of uncertainty in Cambodia's economic and political spheres.
- The comparison with WUIKHM underscores the importance of methodology in capturing diverse uncertainties.
- The anecdotal evidence from news articles complements the findings, providing real-world instances of uncertainty in various sectors, as illustrated in Figure 1.

In conclusion, this analysis provides a multifaceted view of uncertainty, encompassing both policy-related aspects and broader socio-economic factors, demonstrating the efficacy of the topic-based approach in uncertainty analysis.
