# Evaluation of the Topic-Based Uncertainty Measures

Evaluating the effectiveness of the topic-based measures of policy uncertainty is a crucial part of this research. Our evaluation methods are twofold; first, a narrative approach that involves a manual examination of articles, and second, a comparison to alternative, established measures of uncertainty.

## Narrative Approach

One of the key strengths of a topic-based measure of uncertainty is that it allows us to understand the narrative driving the uncertainty. As part of the evaluation process, we select a subset of articles that are associated with the highest uncertainty scores according to our model. For each of these articles, we undertake a thorough content analysis, aiming to discern the primary sources of uncertainty.

The main objective of this step is to establish whether the sources of uncertainty identified by our model align with those identified through a direct examination of the articles. This process involves exploring if our model is correctly identifying the nature of uncertainty, such as whether it is related to exchange rate policy, currency stabilization policy, de-dollarization policy, or international monetary policy.

Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to understand the factors contributing to policy uncertainty within these broad categories. For example, if an article about exchange rate policy has a high uncertainty score, we delve into the specifics of that article to discern the drivers of that uncertainty, whether it be geopolitical events, economic forecasts, or domestic political considerations.

## Comparison to Alternative Uncertainty Measures

An additional method to evaluate our model involves comparing our results with alternative measures of policy uncertainty. These may include the Economic Policy Uncertainty Index (Baker, Bloom, and Davis, 2016) and the Policy Uncertainty Index (Bachmann, Elstner, and Sims, 2013). Although these indices utilize different data sources and methodologies, they offer a useful point of comparison for our topic-based measures.

We first examine the correlation between our topic-based uncertainty measures and these alternative indices over time. We expect a reasonably strong positive correlation if our measures are capturing true policy uncertainty effectively.

Next, we look at the relative magnitudes of the measures. While we don't expect exact numerical alignment given the different methodologies, large divergences in relative magnitudes may be indicative of potential issues with our measures.

Finally, we cross-examine the sources of policy uncertainty highlighted by these alternative measures with those identified by our topic-based model. Consistency in these sources would further validate our topic-based approach.

Through a combination of these narrative and comparative methods, we aim to provide a robust evaluation of our topic-based uncertainty measures, ensuring they capture policy uncertainty effectively, and can be a valuable tool in understanding and predicting economic outcomes.
