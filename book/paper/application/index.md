## Application of the Topic-Based Uncertainty Measure in Econometric Models

Recent advancements in econometrics have seen a growing adoption of sophisticated models to evaluate monetary policy within the sphere of economic policy uncertainty. These models, including the shock-restricted vector-autoregression model, quantile regression model, Panel Smooth Transition Regression (PSTR) model, and the FAVAR model with external instruments, are pivotal in dissecting the multifaceted impacts of monetary policy shocks. They explore the ramifications across various economic domains, encompassing financial and real uncertainty, the efficacy of monetary policies, stock market behavior, and corporate dynamics. Recent studies underscore the variable influences of monetary policies across different uncertainty regimes.

1. **Enhancement of Econometric Models**:

   - Our topic-based uncertainty measure, grounded in comprehensive text analysis, provides an innovative proxy for economic policy uncertainty. Its integration into established econometric models like the shock-restricted vector-autoregression augments their capacity to assess the influence of monetary policy shocks on diverse uncertainty facets.
   - For example, in the quantile regression framework, this measure assists in elucidating the effects of US economic policy uncertainty on the efficiency of Chinese monetary policy across varied efficacy quantiles. Such insights are particularly valuable during periods marked by heightened global economic fluctuations.

2. **Refinement of Model Sensitivity**:

   - Employing the topic-based uncertainty measure can refine the sensitivity of models like PSTR. This model, benefiting from the measure, can effectively analyze the non-linear and dynamic relationships between monetary policies and economic outcomes such as stock returns and firm dynamics, particularly under fluctuating uncertainty levels.

3. **Application in FAVAR Model**:
   - In the FAVAR model, the utilization of the topic-based uncertainty measure as an external instrument can isolate the direct impacts of monetary policies on economic variables. Its wide-ranging capture of uncertainties serves as a robust tool in unraveling the intricate interplay between monetary policies and economic outcomes.

The integration of our uncertainty measure in these models aligns with and enriches recent empirical findings. For instance, the observed dichotomy where contractionary monetary policy shocks might decrease financial uncertainty but escalate real uncertainty can be better understood and quantified. Furthermore, this approach can elucidate the complex relationship between unexpected monetary policy shifts and stock market responses under varying uncertainty conditions, as well as the impact of monetary policy uncertainty shocks during recessionary periods on corporate dynamics.

Incorporating the topic-based uncertainty measure derived from our research into these econometric models paves the way for a more profound comprehension of the intricate interplay between monetary policy and a range of economic indicators under diverse states of uncertainty. This methodological advancement significantly contributes to the empirical discourse on the efficacy of monetary policy in uncertain economic climates, thereby enriching the analytical toolkit available to researchers and policymakers alike.

## Policy Recommendations for the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC)

Our research, building on the insights from previous studies, underscores the imperative of effective central bank communication in mitigating economic uncertainty. It's been widely recognized that clear, forward-looking announcements, adept management of inflation expectations through point projections, and strategic financial stability communication are pivotal. The role of language in enhancing public comprehension and trust, and the necessity of balancing diverse monetary policy viewpoints to sharpen market foresight for interest rate trends, are also crucial. Transparency in future policy assumptions is another key element that bolsters policy predictability. These aspects are particularly significant for central banks like the NBC, which operates in a dollarized economy with a limited array of monetary policy tools.

1. **Enhancement of Communication via Topic Modeling**:

   - The NBC is advised to harness the insights from our topic-based uncertainty analysis to refine its communication strategies. Analyzing textual data from a variety of sources enables the NBC to align its communication more effectively with public sentiments and market expectations.

2. **Simplification of Monetary Policy Discourse**:

   - Given the intrinsic complexities of monetary policies, especially in a dollarized economy, it is recommended that the NBC simplifies its communication. Utilizing straightforward, non-technical language will demystify policy decisions and fortify public trust.

3. **Harmonizing Consensus with Diverse Perspectives**:

   - It's crucial for the NBC to maintain a balance between presenting a unified policy stance and transparently communicating varied economic outlooks and interest rate forecasts. This approach will enrich market understanding and anticipation of future monetary policies.

4. **Transparency in Future Policy Communication**:

   - Utilizing the text-based uncertainty measure, the NBC can pinpoint areas in its future policy communication that require greater clarity. This will aid in making the bank's policy assumptions and decision-making processes more transparent.

5. **Reputation Management and Development**:

   - The NBC should employ text-based analysis to identify and address areas where its reputation is evolving or requires strengthening. Targeted communication efforts in these areas can significantly boost the bank's credibility.

6. **Regular Economic Updates**:

   - By applying topic modeling techniques to assess public reaction to economic updates, the NBC should commit to providing regular and detailed updates on Cambodia's economic conditions, including key indicators like inflation and exchange rates.

7. **Active Role in Financial Stability Communication**:

   - The NBC's proactive participation in financial stability communication, particularly in the context of a dollarized economy, is imperative. This includes engaging in interagency financial stability committees and leveraging text-based uncertainty measures for effective communication about financial stability issues.

8. **Emphasis on Local Currency Stabilization**:
   - The NBC should place special emphasis on communicating strategies aimed at stabilizing the local currency, Riel, to effectively manage expectations in a predominantly dollarized economic environment.

Implementing these recommendations will enable the NBC to utilize text-based uncertainty measures to optimize its communication strategy. This, in turn, is anticipated to significantly reduce policy uncertainty and contribute to a more stable and predictable economic environment in Cambodia. The adoption of these strategies will be instrumental in aligning the NBC's communication with the evolving economic landscape and the nuanced expectations of various economic stakeholders.
