- [Phnom Penh Post](https://www.phnompenhpost.com/)

## Data Collection

For the purpose of this research, we will be utilizing articles from three major news outlets in Cambodia: Khmer Times and Phnom Penh Post. These sources were chosen for their relevance, comprehensiveness, and reputation as credible news platforms in Cambodia, providing a diverse range of coverage on the economic and financial matters of the country.

**1. Khmer Times**

Khmer Times is a major English language newspaper in Cambodia. It covers a wide range of topics, including domestic and international news, politics, business, lifestyle, and culture. The newspaper is known for its extensive coverage of economic issues, including the country's monetary policy.

**2. Phnom Penh Post**

The Phnom Penh Post is the oldest independent newspaper in Cambodia, offering both English and Khmer editions. It provides in-depth coverage of various topics, from politics to economy, lifestyle, and culture. It is particularly regarded for its detailed analysis of domestic economic affairs and policies.

We will gather articles from these sources using automated methods.

## Gathering the Raw Dataset

**Web Scraping:**

We will use web scraping tools to extract articles from the websites of the three news outlets. The Python libraries `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` will be particularly useful for this task. We will extract the headline, date, and full text of each article.

**Keyword Filtering:**

Once we have a comprehensive dataset of articles, we will filter the articles based on relevant keywords related to economic policy, such as "National Bank of Cambodia", "monetary policy", "exchange rate", "currency stabilization", "de-dollarization", and "U.S. Federal Reserve", among others. This will ensure we are only analyzing articles relevant to our research.

**Time Frame:**

We will determine a specific time frame for our study, and only gather articles published within this period. This will allow us to understand the evolution of policy uncertainty over a specified period of time.

This dataset will provide a rich source of information from which to analyze and measure the uncertainty surrounding Cambodia's central bank policy.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We have collected 40,002 articles from the three news outlets. The articles were published between January 1, 2016 and July 31, 2023.
