# Introduction

Cambodia, a highly dollarized economy, faces significant constraints in implementing independent monetary policy. Despite the expansion of the use of its national currency, the Riel, based on high growth in the 2000s, the Central Bank of Cambodia (National Bank of Cambodia, NBC) is challenged by the underdevelopment of its financial market, making it difficult to possess modern monetary policy tools.

In a situation where market mechanisms for monetary policy are insufficient, it is even more urgent to build appropriate monetary policy communication tools and strategies than in economies with advanced monetary policy tools. This is crucial to minimize policy uncertainty that may arise in the process of de-dollarization and modernization of monetary policy implementation.

In this context, measuring central bank policy uncertainty is a crucial step in understanding the impact of policy uncertainty on the economy and financial markets. This is also important for the central bank to communicate its policy stance to the public and financial markets.

Narrative nature of the topic-based method is suitable for measuring central bank policy uncertainty. The topic-based method is a text-based method that uses topic modeling to measure uncertainty. It is a method that can be used to measure uncertainty in a variety of contexts, including central bank policy uncertainty.

Given that Cambodia is a highly dollarized economy, the monetary policy usually revolves around managing the currency, specifically the balance between the U.S. Dollar and the local Cambodian Riel. Thus, the uncertainty in this context would primarily concern shifts and changes in currency management policies, and the potential impact these could have on the economy. This can include policy changes or uncertainty related to exchange rates, currency stabilization efforts, and de-dollarization policies.

In light of these factors, our research aims to measure the following aspects:

**Exchange Rate Policy Uncertainty:**

Changes in exchange rate policy or uncertainty about future exchange rate policy can have profound impacts on the economy. Therefore, this research will measure the level of uncertainty in news coverage related to the exchange rate policy of the NBC. This includes analyzing how frequently exchange rate policy is discussed, the context in which it is discussed (positive or negative), and the level of ambiguity in these discussions.

**Currency Stabilization Policy Uncertainty:**

The National Bank of Cambodia has a crucial role in maintaining the stability of the Cambodian Riel against foreign currencies, primarily the U.S. Dollar. Therefore, any uncertainty about the stabilization policies could affect the confidence of the markets and the public in the currency. We will measure this by focusing on articles that discuss changes, or potential changes, in currency stabilization strategies, and the implications of these for the economy.

**De-dollarization Policy Uncertainty:**

The process of de-dollarization, or reducing the economy's reliance on the U.S. Dollar, is a major policy area for the NBC. Uncertainty about the timeline, strategy, or potential impacts of de-dollarization could influence economic behavior. By analyzing news articles discussing de-dollarization, we will gauge the level of uncertainty associated with these policies.

**Impact of International Monetary Policy Uncertainty:**

Given Cambodia's dollarized economy, policy changes or uncertainties in the U.S. Federal Reserve's monetary policy can also affect Cambodia. We will measure the uncertainty emanating from discussions about international monetary policies and their potential impact on Cambodia's economy.

These measurements will provide a comprehensive understanding of central bank policy uncertainty in the context of a highly dollarized economy like Cambodia.
