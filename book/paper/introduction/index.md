# Introduction

Cambodia, a highly dollarized economy, grapples with unique challenges in implementing independent monetary policy. Despite the growth and expansion of its national currency, the Riel, in the 2000s, the Central Bank of Cambodia (National Bank of Cambodia, NBC) faces hurdles stemming from the underdevelopment of its financial market. This lack of modern monetary policy tools exacerbates the complexity of managing the monetary system.

In an environment where traditional market mechanisms for monetary policy are underdeveloped, the urgency to construct appropriate monetary policy communication tools and strategies becomes paramount. This necessity is accentuated in Cambodia's context, where the process of de-dollarization and modernization of monetary policy implementation may give rise to policy uncertainty. Minimizing this uncertainty is vital for the stability and predictability of the monetary system.

Measuring central bank policy uncertainty, therefore, emerges as a critical endeavor in understanding its multifaceted impact on the Cambodian economy and financial markets. It also holds significant implications for the central bank's ability to articulate its policy stance to the public and financial markets, fostering transparency and confidence.

The narrative nature of the topic-based method, as revealed in our evaluation, proves to be particularly suitable for measuring central bank policy uncertainty in Cambodia. This text-based method employs topic modeling to gauge uncertainty, offering a nuanced understanding of the underlying themes and drivers. It transcends mere quantification, providing insights into the specific nature of uncertainty, whether related to exchange rate policy, currency stabilization efforts, or de-dollarization policies.

In Cambodia's highly dollarized economic landscape, monetary policy often centers on the intricate management of currency, particularly balancing the U.S. Dollar and the Cambodian Riel. The uncertainty in this context is multifaceted, encompassing potential shifts in currency management policies and their subsequent impact on the economy. This complexity underscores the importance of a robust and context-specific approach to measuring and understanding policy uncertainty, a challenge that our research aims to address through the application and evaluation of the topic-based method. The insights derived from this approach not only contribute to the academic discourse on policy uncertainty but also hold practical relevance for policymakers, economists, and financial analysts navigating Cambodia's unique monetary landscape.
