project_description: 'Understanding and measuring central bank policy uncertainty
    are fundamental to predicting economic outcomes, particularly in economies like
    Cambodia where the monetary policy tools are underdeveloped and the economy is
    heavily dollarized. This study aims to develop and evaluate topic-based measures
    of policy uncertainty in the Cambodian context, using narrative text data derived
    from major news media outlets. Leveraging Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a
    widely-used generative model for text data, we estimate the document-topic and
    topic-word distributions from a corpus of news articles, thereby deriving measures
    of policy uncertainty.


    Our methodology involves applying two topic models: one classifies articles into
    four categories of interest - Exchange Rate Policy Uncertainty, Currency Stabilization
    Policy Uncertainty, De-dollarization Policy Uncertainty, and International Monetary
    Policy Impact Uncertainty; the other quantifies the intensity of uncertainty within
    these articles. We use a seed word approach to guide the LDA in determining relevant
    topics and the level of associated uncertainty.


    The effectiveness of these measures is evaluated via a narrative approach, analyzing
    articles with high uncertainty scores, and through comparison with established
    policy uncertainty indices. The proposed methodology and findings offer valuable
    insights for central banks and policymakers in dollarized economies, like Cambodia,
    enhancing their communication strategies to effectively manage policy uncertainty
    and its economic implications.
